                    <h2>Sustainable Use of Natural Resources</h2>
                    <p>Conservation efforts also involve finding ways to use natural resources sustainably without compromising the health of ecosystems or the survival of species. This includes promoting sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, reducing overfishing, and limiting resource extraction.</p>

                    <p>Ecosystem-based management: Ecosystem-based management is an approach to the sustainable use of natural resources that considers the entire ecosystem, including the interactions between different species and the environment. This approach recognizes that human activities can have both positive and negative impacts on the ecosystem, and seeks to minimize negative impacts while maximizing the benefits of natural resources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Resource monitoring and assessment: Resource monitoring and assessment is important for sustainable use of natural resources. This involves collecting data on the status of natural resources, including fish stocks, timber, and water resources, to ensure that they are being used at a sustainable rate. This information can be used to inform management decisions and to identify areas where conservation efforts are needed.</p>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Community-based management: Community-based management involves working with local communities to manage natural resources in a sustainable way. This approach recognizes that local communities often have a deep understanding of the local ecosystem, and can play an important role in resource management. By involving local communities in resource management, it is possible to ensure that the needs of local people are met while protecting the environment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sustainable harvesting: Sustainable harvesting is a key component of the sustainable use of natural resources. This involves harvesting natural resources at a rate that allows the resource to replenish itself naturally, without causing long-term damage to the ecosystem. Sustainable harvesting practices can include selective logging, regulated fishing, and controlled hunting. These practices can help ensure that natural resources are available for future generations while also supporting the livelihoods of local communities.</p>
