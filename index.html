                    <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
                    <p>Biodiversity is the variety of life on earth and includes all living organisms, from the smallest microbes to the largest mammals. It encompasses not just the number of species but also the genetic diversity within and among species, and the diversity of ecosystems and their interactions. Biodiversity is a fundamental part of our planet's ecological systems, providing essential ecosystem services such as clean air and water, soil fertility, and climate regulation. It is also a source of cultural, aesthetic, and economic value.</p>
